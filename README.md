### Share counts

```js
import {
  FacebookShareCount,
  GooglePlusShareCount,
  LinkedinShareCount,
  PinterestShareCount,
  VKShareCount,
  OKShareCount,
  RedditShareCount,
  TumblrShareCount,
} from 'react-share';
```

All share count components take in only one mandatory prop: `url`, which is the
URL you are sharing. `className` prop is optional.

Example:

```jsx
<FacebookShareCount url={shareUrl} />
```

If you want to render anything else but the count,
you can provide a function as a child element that takes in `shareCount` as an
argument and returns an element:

```jsx
<FacebookShareCount url={shareUrl}>
  {shareCount => (
    <span className="myShareCountWrapper">{shareCount}</span>
  )}
</FacebookShareCount>
```

### Icons

```js
import {
  FacebookIcon,
  TwitterIcon,
  TelegramIcon,
  WhatsappIcon,
  GooglePlusIcon,
  LinkedinIcon,
  PinterestIcon,
  VKIcon,
  OKIcon,
  RedditIcon,
  TumblrIcon,
  LivejournalIcon,
  MailruIcon,
  ViberIcon,
  WorkplaceIcon,
  LineIcon,
  EmailIcon,
} from 'react-share';
```

Props:

* `size`: Icon size in pixels (number)

* `round`: Whether to show round or rect icons (bool)

* `iconBgStyle`: customize background style, e.g. `fill` (object)

* `logoFillColor`: customize logo's fill color (string, default = 'white')

Example:
```
<TwitterIcon size={32} round={true} />
```

### About semantic versioning

This library uses the standard semver convention. However, the share buttons and and counts are prone to lots of changes that are not in control of this library. For example: if Facebook decides to change or deprecate it's API in a major way, this library will not get a major version bump just because of that. Keep this in mind when you are planning the maintenance of your application.
